# ArtPad

ArtPad is designed to be an artisian tray that also functions as a macro pad.  This repository contains two PCB designs.  `pcb` is the choc hotswap version, and `pcb-chocmini` uses Choc Mini switches which can be built to be slightly thinner.  Both PCBs feature per-key RGB, an OLED display, and an optional rotary encoder.

## PCB Details
My original design uses Choc hotswap sockets which offers the most versatility since Choc switches come in a varity of flavors.  I later decided to design a slimmer version that uses Choc Mini switches, but limits you to only 3 types of switches (linear, tactile, and clicky) and is not hotswapable.  Below are the heights measured from the lowest point of the switch (pin) to the top of the keycap ([wrk pure](https://worklouder.cc/shop/wrk-pure/) from Work Louder).
